				We started off as a primary school, only attending to grades ranging from 1-7, but due to the sudden

				Mzamomtsha School is in the remote 
				township of Driftsands. 
				
				The school has a severe 
				shortage of classrooms and chairs. 
				
				This follows an early 2018 instruction 
				from the district office for the school 
				
				to accommodate children who could not 
				fit into overcrowded Mfuleni schools. 
				
				The Department of Education promised the 
				school mobile classes to help handle the 
				
				increased learner population, but these 
				have still had not been delivered. 
				</p>
        			<p>
				Parents organised a protest to highlight 
				the school's needs, but nothing has 
				
				changed. Frustrations are growing, and 
				parents are even contemplating closing 
				
				down the school permanently as they feel 
				the learning conditions their children 
				
				are enduring are unacceptable.
