				Mzamomtsha School is in the remote township of Driftsands. The school has a severe shortage of classrooms and chairs. This follows an early 2018 instruction from the district office for the school to accommodate children who could not fit into overcrowded Mfuleni schools. The Department of Education promised the school mobile classes to help handle the increased learner population, but these have still had not been delivered. Parents organised a protest to highlight the school’s needs, but nothing has changed. Frustrations are growing, and parents are even contemplating closing down the school permanently as they feel the learning conditions their childrenare enduring are unacceptable.
